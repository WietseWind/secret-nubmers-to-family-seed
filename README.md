# WARNING

If you generated your Secret Numbers in a secure client like XUMM, converting your Secret Numbers to
a family seed to use in 3rd party applications MAY BE A RISK! If those 3rd party applications are
insecure, or you enter your Family Seed (secret) in an unsecure environment, or copy/paste on a
compromised device, you are at risk of LOSING ALL YOUR FUNDS.

## Please note that the best way to run this, is by getting the source, installing the dependencies (see "Compile" below) and run this offline on your own device.
